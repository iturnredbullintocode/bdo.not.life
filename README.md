Sometimes I worry that the applications I code are too portable but
I decided to make this public for now. May private later.

There do not seem to be any websites for BD Mobile that are focused on easily viewable
written content, most are filled with video tutorials, which are not intuitive to consume.
I aim to fill this gap and use this website to test one of my handwritten private PHP
frameworks on a medium audience of users.


Current Objectives
==================
- porting my genshin app into here and modifying as bdm
- bdm discord
- getting repo into a perfect and clean state

My apologies for using this readme to brainstorm, but I'd like the users to see my thought process today.


General Notes for Readers
=========================
üçë I do play BDM, but I've only played for 2 weeks. I'm only 36k cp.
I main a spiritwalker. I used to play BDO back when it first launched, and run a BDO
database website.

Structure
=========
- "application" folder is the only one that gets uploaded in its entirety to a PHP host server
- "resources" is for items that aid with website creation but aren't meant to be served online,
such my original photoshop layered images for the UI
- everything outside of these two folders is meant to be kept to a minimum to prevent messiness
